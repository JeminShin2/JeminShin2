# Hi Im Jemin.Shin

### I learned P5.js in the previous semester and made a simple rhythm game with p5.js!
### I studied more about vectors, but I'm still confused about that.
### Also, I'm confused with the C++ programming I'm learning right now. :)
### I don't know if I can do it well, but I'll do my best!
